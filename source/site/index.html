        <p class="lead">I am Tyler, but most probably know me better simply as <a class="green-highlight" href="https://underlost.net">underlost</a>.
            I’m a somewhat unusual hybrid of designer and developer, with an interest of <a href="http://tyler.camera/">photography</a> and <a href="http://alifewellplayed.com/">video games</a> mixed in on the side.</p>

        <p>I am currently working as a web developer at <a href="https://www.hellowildern.com/">Wildern</a>.</p>

    <div class="layout-single-column fadeLeft">
        <p>In a past life, I had a background in information computer security and built a successful web hosting business. I’ve since returned to my true passion of web development and virtual reality, where I love exploring and experimenting with new web trends and technology.</p>

        <p>If you've ever liked something on the internet, you’ve probably seen some of my work. I'm sorry.</p>
