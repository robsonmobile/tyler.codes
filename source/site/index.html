        <p>I am Tyler, but most probably know me better simply as <a class="green-highlight" href="https://underlost.net">underlost</a>.
            I’m a somewhat unusual hybrid of designer and developer, with an interest of <a href="http://tyler.camera/">photography</a> and <a href="http://alifewellplayed.com/">video games</a> mixed in on the side.</p>

        <p>I am currently working as a web developer at <a href="https://www.hellowildern.com/">Wildern</a>.</p>

    <div data-animate="fadeLeft" class="layout-single-column">
        <p>In a past life, I had a background in information computer security and built a successful web hosting business. Since then, I've worked as a UI designer for a couple video games and virtual reality experiences.</p>

        <p>If you've ever liked something on the internet, interacted with an eye catching VR experience, or visited the Wine Country, you’ve probably seen some of my work. <em>I'm sorry</em>.</p>
