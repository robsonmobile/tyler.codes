  <p class="lead">This site serves as a link list of various relevant sites and projects I'm involved with.</p>
  <p>Sites like Instagram only provide a single link in your bio. I built this site as a way to easily link to blog posts, ands anything recent or interesting I might want to share on Instargram and other sites, with out the need to always update the profile link.</p>
  <p>For more information about myself, make sure to check out my personal site, <a href="https://underlost.net">underlost.net</a>.</p>
