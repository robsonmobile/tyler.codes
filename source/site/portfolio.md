Below are some projects Iâ€™ve worked on. They demonstrate some of my abilities, ranging from coding to design. Some of the listed projects can also be found on my [Github](https://github.com/underlost/) page. For photography, make sure to check out my [photo blog](http://tyler.camera/), as well as my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/underlost/) page.

I also occasionally write about projects on and share my thoughts on my other site, [A Life Well Played](https://alifewellplayed.com).
