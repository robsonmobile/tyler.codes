For the longest time, I've been using a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and Gulp stack for building my personal sites, that I dubbed Undertasker. While I still use parts of the gulpfile in new projects (especially WordPress based), I decided it was finally time tojump on the React bandwagon.

I wanted to create something a little more modern, that would let me do some simple page transitions and animations around the site.

It's still a work in progress as I add more content (maybe even some video?), but it's finally in a good enough place that I'm happy to launch it!
