Sites like Instagram only provide a single link in your bio. I built this site as a way to easily link to blog posts, ands anything recent or interesting I might want to share on Instargram and other sites, with out the need to always update the profile link.

For more information about myself, make sure to check out my personal site [underlost.net](https://underlost.net).
